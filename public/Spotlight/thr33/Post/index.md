## 🔑 3 Insights Br. Riaz Has Gained

2. **Leading with Hikmah** → Wisdom with balance and foresight guides every decision, from staffing to programming. That hikmah keeps the venture sustainable and values-driven when things get busy.
3. **Mutual Respect** → Even on the toughest days, respect is a non-negotiable. Br. Riaz believes the ummah flourishes when every interaction honours dignity.
