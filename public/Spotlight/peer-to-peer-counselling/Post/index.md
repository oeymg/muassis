From repairing phones to repairing hearts

Growing up, Sr. Nadima was known for advocating and speaking up — her mother recalls, “She was always the one asking the questions.” She dreamed of becoming a lawyer, driven by her instinct to stand up for others.

After high school, a marriage proposal shifted her path. Together with her husband, she opened a mobile-phone repair shop — but it was there that her true purpose quietly revealed itself. As customers waited for their phones, they shared stories of their lives. Nadima listened, empathised, and realised her gift wasn’t fixing phones — it was healing people.
One day, a customer who had broken down in conversation returned with flowers, a quiet thank-you for something far deeper than a repaired device. It was in that moment Sr. Nadima understood: her business was never just about phones. It was about people.

She pursued studies in psychology and counselling, graduating with distinction. Today, as the Founder of Peer to Peer Counselling, she combines faith, empathy, and professionalism to serve her community.
While being known in the community once created hesitation among potential clients, she has since built deep trust through patience, sincerity, and confidentiality. Alongside her own venture, Sr. Nadima also facilitates workshops with the Be There Group, helping schools and workplaces prevent harassment and discrimination.

## 🌱 Why This Matters to Mu’assis

Sr. Nadima’s story reminds us that entrepreneurship isn’t only about innovation — it’s about intention. When Muslims unlock the faith within them and lead with empathy and purpose, their work becomes more than a career; it becomes an act of worship, a reflection of trust in Allah, and a source of healing for the ummah.
