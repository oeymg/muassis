Some people show entrepreneurial spirit long before they even realise what it is.
For Br. Aqueel, that spark appeared early.

In Year 6 and 7, he went door-to-door asking neighbours if he could wash their red or yellow bins for $2 each. His mindset, even then, reflected a belief that has stayed with him: “If you want something, start. Don’t wait for anyone to give it to you.” In early high school that grew even bolder. He would walk to the local 7/11, collect boxes of Krispy Kreme doughnuts that were about to be thrown out, and sell them at school the next morning. They became so popular that some students who didn’t have money offered to help him sell. His deal was simple: “If you sell a box of four doughnuts, I’ll give you one free.” At the same time, he noticed all the “cool kids” were wearing silver and gold Casio digital watches. Seeing an opportunity, he jumped on eBay, bought five of each, and flipped them at school. They sold fast. That moment gave him one of his earliest business principles: “Pay attention, move fast, and meet demand - that’s business.”

He remembers those days fondly, not because of the small profits, but because he loved the chase and the thrill of working on something he built: “I loved doing something on my own terms. That feeling, I’ve been chasing it ever since.”

By Year 11 and 12, he was already running a small cleaning business at a construction firm. He would pick up his younger brother from school, then head straight to the office to clean until the job was done. But, school wasn’t easy 

Born with a hearing impairment, Aqueel spent many years in an alternative learning unit away from mainstream classes. Socially, he struggled to feel included, to feel “normal.” ADHD made concentration difficult, the restlessness, the distraction, the feeling of constantly being behind.

He did not speak properly until eight years old, and some parents warned their children to stay away from him because he was “the naughty kid.” In truth, he was misunderstood. Looking back, he says: “That isolation sticks to you. You don’t forget it. But you can use it.” He learnt sign language long before he developed proper speech, navigating both the deaf and hearing worlds. It was difficult, but that difficulty shaped his grit:

“Living between two worlds forced me to work twice as hard to be recognised.”
“Despite everything, I can do anything now. Don’t let your disability hold you back.”

Those beliefs would later become the foundation of his character and leadership.

After graduating, Aqueel didn’t know what career to pursue. But what he did know was this: “If a door opens, don’t hesitate, walk through it.” He spoke to the right people and soon secured his first courier contractor role. It wasn’t glamorous, but he worked hard and said “yes” to every opportunity that came his way. Later, he moved into biosecurity work, and found something unexpected, he enjoyed it. It was hands-on and practical, and he began asking himself a question that changed everything: “Could this become a business one day?”

Though, when COVID struck, Aqueel was unexpectedly dismissed from his role. It was a blow to his self-worth and stability. But instead of breaking him, it fuelled him: “It pushed me. I had to figure out how to make money on my own terms, fast.” At that lowest point, came his greatest support,  his wife, Nagma , who encouraged him to back himself and build something of his own.

So, with almost nothing, Aqueel purchased a small scale pest control business called Response Pest Control.He started as a one-man operator. Even today, he remains highly hands-on, but now oversees extensive operations supported by various subcontractors. His work was fast, professional and reliable, so much so that more work followed. His operating standard became simple:“Be proactive. Be fast. Be professional.” While most took weeks, he would already have the job prepared in advance and completed within days. That level of responsiveness became his trademark. From Brisbane, his reach grew to Sydney, Melbourne, and Cairns.

What fuelled his growth?

Aqueel explains it with clarity:

“Find the decision-makers.”
“Listen carefully and solve people’s problems.”
“If the service is that good, the right clients will pay.”

That mindset built a multi-city operation from nearly nothing.

He speaks openly about the tall-poppy mentality he has seen in communities:

“Too many people compete instead of collaborate.”
