From surviving to serving

Br. Ali’s story began far from where he stands today. Born in Iraq, his early years were defined by hardship and uncertainty. At just six years old, he began working to help support his family. Later, they lived in a refugee camp, a place with no security, no steady access to food, and no clear future.

When the opportunity came to move to Australia, Ali arrived with one intention: to rebuild. With no formal qualifications, he started wherever he could, first at a petrol station, then at a fruit shop. But one day, a simple advertisement caught his eye. The words were few but powerful: “You can change your life.”

That moment changed everything. Ali decided to pursue education, first a diploma, then a bachelor’s degree, and eventually a PhD. Each step was driven by a deep belief that growth wasn’t limited by circumstance, but by mindset and effort.

After years of working under the direction of others, Ali’s experience and education made it clear that he was capable of starting something of his own, something that reflected his values and vision. That vision became AMG Pest Management, a business known not only for its professionalism but for its integrity, compassion, and community spirit.

Through his own experience, Ali values giving back to the community, just as the community supported him when he first arrived in Australia. Under his leadership, AMG has become more than a pest control company. It sponsors local initiatives, supports community projects, and uplifts others quietly, with humility and sincerity.

Today, that spirit of service lives on in every client interaction, every project, and every act of giving back.

## 🔑 3 Insights Br. Ali Has Gained
1️⃣ Listen to others.

Take time to understand people’s perspectives and the reasons behind their choices. Everyone has something to teach you, if you’re willing to listen and apply their wisdom to your own journey.

2️⃣ Don’t rush.

Success doesn’t come overnight. Have sabr in what you do; good things take time. Growth, like faith, requires patience and perseverance.

3️⃣ Continue the initiatives.

Ali often recalls a story from a family member who planted a date tree, knowing it would take generations to grow. The lesson: your efforts today may not bloom tomorrow, but they can bear fruit for those who come after you.

## 💬 Founder Takeaway

“Mu’assis is powerful because it tells the stories that show what’s possible. When we share our journeys, we remind others that they can build too.”

## 🌱 Why This Matters to Mu’assis

Br. Ali’s story reminds us that every seed of struggle carries potential for service. When Muslims work with ihsan (excellence and sincerity) our businesses become more than income streams; they become acts of worship that strengthen families, uplift communities, and honour the journey that brought us here.
