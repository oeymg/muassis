After 18+ years in corporate environments, Br. Sidqie came to a realisation – something was missing. The question arose: *What legacy can I leave behind that continues to benefit after death? How can I help others become better versions of themselves in how they lead their lives?*  

With faith that Allah plants seeds in our hearts as inspiration to serve Him, he founded **The Growth Table** — a venture dedicated to empowering leaders to rise and grow with purpose, grounded in the universal principles exemplified by our Rasulullah ﷺ: servant leadership, emotional intelligence, trust, compassion, and human-centred values that honour our fitrah.  

These aren’t just “Islamic principles” — they’re **human principles that Islam perfected**. They speak to every leader who seeks meaning beyond profit, who wants to build cultures where people are valued, not just utilised.  

The Growth Table serves both Muslim and non-Muslim leaders — those not willing to chase monetary gain at the expense of their own soul & heart, their family wellbeing, and the people they lead. For those who understand that if we want to change the trajectory of our communities and our ummah, it starts with how we lead our own lives first.

## 🔑 3 Insights Br. Sidqie Has Gained  

1. **Finding and Nurturing Your Gift** → Allah will ask you about the gift He gave you. Your responsibility is to recognise it, nurture it to grow & flourish — because one day you will be asked what you did with it.  

2. **Taking the Steps, Even Without a ‘Clear Map’** → Amplify the WHY, and Allah will guide you with the HOW. At times you feel inspired by a vision, an idea, or goals… and you know this is your vehicle toward Allah’s Jannah. But doubt whispers: *How?* Deepen your relationship with Allah. Cultivate trust from your heart. He will guide you step by step.  

3. **Be Curious & Courageous** → Approach every interaction as if you are collecting puzzle pieces. By learning from peers and exchanging those pieces, your relationships and self-awareness continue to grow. And be courageous enough to challenge the thinking that limits you from becoming who you’re meant to be.

## 💬 Founder Takeaway  
> *“Mu’assis to be a think tank — where founders, thought leaders, and emerging leaders come into proximity with one another, inspiring each other to hold the world in their hands and Allah in their hearts.”*

## 🌱 Why This Matters to Mu’assis  
The Growth Table is a reminder that **leadership itself is an act of worship**. When Muslim founders nurture their gifts with sincerity, they don’t just build businesses — they cultivate purposeful leaders who serve their Rabb, strengthen the ummah, and model what it means to lead with humanity at the core.
