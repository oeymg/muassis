### From Struggle to Service: Br. Ansary’s Journey

Br. Ansary’s journey started long before Merciful Servants existed. He grew up seeing the struggle of people who had nothing. His parents taught him the value of giving, even when they didn’t have much themselves. His father passed away when he was just 11 years old. Br. Ansary’s mum raised him through hardship and some of the kind community members were there through struggles.

For Ansary, community service didn’t begin as a project; it began as a responsibility. Over 14 years ago, Ansary and his team started by giving out just 20 meals, thinking it might ease someone’s hardship for one night. Today, by Allah’s mercy, that small effort has grown into a movement that has served over half a million people from Logan to Brisbane. This isn’t just Br. Ansary’s mission but also his wife’s, Fiaza. Sr. Fiaza is responsible for all the accounts of Merciful Servants, its operations, and, in supporting Br. Ansary endlessly.

As such, Ansary has been able to work full-time, manage teams, learn about business, leadership, problem solving, and how to deal with all kinds of people. Those entrepreneurial lessons fed directly into Merciful Servants—building systems, leading volunteers, partnering with businesses, running projects, organising events, and constantly expanding the vision.

Br. Ansary also heads the Muslim Tradies Network; with over 80 businesses in the network that they are growing through the community.

His journey has been about service, sacrifice, and growth: spiritually, mentally, and as a leader. Every meal, every conversation with someone struggling, every young volunteer who joins Merciful Servants, it’s part of a much bigger purpose: building a community based on compassion, dignity, and hope.

### 🔑 3 Insights Br. Ansary Has Gained

1️⃣ Consistency beats everything.  
You speak to anyone on the street we haven't missed a week of service.  
You don’t build community with one big event. You build it by showing up every single week, even when you’re tired, even when it’s raining, even when nobody sees the effort.

2️⃣ Service teaches humility.  
When you meet people sleeping rough or mums who give their kids the bed and sleep on the floor themselves, you realise how blessed you are. Helping others keeps your heart soft.

3️⃣ You can’t do this alone.  
Merciful Servants is built on volunteers, youth, teachers, families, businesses, donors — a whole community working together. Leadership is not about doing everything—it’s about empowering others.

### 💬 Founder Takeaway

Today’s youth are growing up in a world full of distraction, pressure, confusion, and negativity. Many don’t have strong role models, guidance, or a sense of identity.  
A program like Mu’assis is important because it builds:

Discipline and routine  
Teaching young men how to carry themselves, control their emotions, and build strong habits.

Identity and faith  
Helping them understand who they are, what they stand for, and how Islam shapes character.

Responsibility and leadership  
Training boys to become men who serve, protect, and contribute to their families and community.

Brotherhood  
Providing a safe, positive environment where young men feel supported, heard, and connected.
