### Reviving Language, Reviving Hearts — The Story of Hamza Surbuland

Hamza Surbuland never imagined he would one day run a business. He didn’t grow up in an entrepreneurial family, nor did he consider himself “business-minded.” Yet his journey into founding Ihya, a language tuition initiative, unfolded through a series of unexpected turns — each one guided by purpose more than profit.

“Ihya” means Revival — a revival of culture, heritage, civilisation, and language. What began five years ago as a small idea slowly transformed into a meaningful project. But Hamza only truly began running it as a business three years ago, driven by two goals: to benefit people and to see whether this passion could sustain him financially.

Today, Ihya is more than a tutoring service. It is a cultural bridge. A vessel of memory. A place where people rediscover who they are through the language of their ancestors through teaching Urdu, Arabic and Persian.

Despite calling himself “not business-minded,” Hamza has built Ihya carefully and sincerely. He works closely with one employee — someone who acts as a sounding board, social media creator, and graphic designer — allowing Hamza to focus entirely on what he loves most: his students.

For him, Ihya has never been about the money. Learning a language is a long journey, and he aims to reduce obstacles wherever he can, including lowering prices to make learning more accessible. Teaching can be tiring, he admits, but he has honed the art of tailoring lessons to each individual — understanding not just how people learn, but why they want to.

One of his favourite success stories is a student in Dubai, a young woman of Pakistani origin who had become disconnected from her mother tongue. She began lessons last year, unsure if she could ever express herself in that language again. Slowly, gently, the words returned.

Hamza says, “Success isn’t fluency. It’s when someone realises they can express themselves — when they thought they couldn’t.”

Her joy became his motivation, a reminder of why Ihya exists.

Because Ihya was born from Hamza’s own journey. He, too, had to reconnect with his heritage without anyone to guide him. He knows the loneliness of that path and holds deep empathy for his students walking the same road. He believes that language is the key to understanding our Muslim heritage. Without it, he says, we are swept into the tides of Western culture — losing the imagination, morals, and worldview embedded in our ancestral tongues.

He sees the difference in how people think, dream, and understand the world — depending on the language they use.

Through Ihya, he hopes to revive not just speech, but identity.

### 🔑 3 Insights Hamza Has Gained

1️⃣ Business is slow and steady — invest in people and systems.  
Hamza learned that growth isn’t rushed. It’s nurtured. Supporting employees, building structure, and moving consistently are the real signs of progress.

2️⃣ This journey is also inward.  
Rediscovering one’s heritage is a journey of the self. As Hamza learned more about his roots, his teaching style evolved, shaped by sincerity, patience, and understanding.

3️⃣ If you see a gap, fill it — someone else needs it.  
Ihya was born because Hamza saw what he wished existed for himself. Now, it becomes a source of inspiration for those seeking the same connection.
