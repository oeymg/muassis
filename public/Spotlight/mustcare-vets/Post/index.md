When Shibly and Rehana first met at the University of Queensland, they were two young students with big dreams — Shibly studying veterinary science and Rehana pursuing journalism. Their paths crossed through the Muslim Students Association, where both were known for their activism and passion for serving others. From the beginning, one thing bound them together: a shared desire to align their careers with service — to people, to creation, and to Allah.

Years later, that vision became reality through **MustCare Vet Centres**. What began with two modest clinics has grown into four thriving practices with over fifty staff, all united by a purpose beyond profit. For Shibly and Rehana, MustCare is more than a business — it’s a foundation for community, training, and service built on faith-centred values.

Rehana, the marketing and systems manager, ensures that every process reflects excellence, integrity, and compassion. Her background in journalism taught her adaptability — when she saw the decline of print media, she pivoted into digital communication, using her skills to connect people and ideas in new ways.

Together, they challenge the modern extremes of scarcity and abundance mindsets — instead, they strive for balance and purpose. For Shibly, life is not an “either/or” equation. He reframed it: “I’m not a business owner or a veterinarian or a father — I’m all three.” To him, excellence in each role is part of worship, a way to serve Allah through everyday action.

### **🔑 3 Insights Shibly & Rehana Have Gained**

**1️⃣ Don’t be everything to everyone. Find your niche.**  
Shibly discovered his calling in serving passionate pet owners: educating, supporting, and guiding them to care for their animals with love and responsibility. True fulfilment comes from depth, not breadth.

**2️⃣ Be intentional with planning and systems.**  
Their first two clinics taught them that growth does not happen by chance. Every dollar spent and every process built must serve a purpose. Structure, not spontaneity, sustains vision.

**3️⃣ Balance through difference.**  
Over time, Shibly and Rehana realised that growth rarely comes from ease. The moments that stretch and challenge us are often the ones that shape us most. Difference became their greatest teacher, showing that contrast, when harnessed with respect, brings strength. Shibly is the visionary, eager to start; Rehana is the strategist, grounding ideas in systems and structure. Together, they show that opposites don’t compete — they complete.

### **💬 Founder Takeaway**

“One morning, I woke up and decided I want to help one billion beings,” Shibly says. “And I realised it starts with one person. Educate one, and there’s a ripple effect. That’s how even the smallest acts in our work become worship.”

### **🌱 Why This Matters to Mu’assis**

Shibly and Rehana remind us that entrepreneurship, when guided by faith, is not just about business growth — it’s also about spiritual growth. Their story embodies the reminder from *Surah Al-Baqarah* to use our wealth, skills, and health in the service of Allah and His creation.
