Growing up, Br. Nabil learned early that if he wanted something, he had to find a way to earn it. When money was tight, he began creating his own opportunities — from unlocking Digimon for classmates to running small ventures long before adulthood. School never quite understood him, and by the end of high school, he stood in what he calls “no man’s land.”  

The elders around him insisted that anything outside medicine, law, or engineering was beneath him. But deep down, he felt called to something else — something he couldn’t yet explain. In grade 10, as his teacher asked what everyone wanted to be, a quiet thought struck him: **“What if... I can employ these people?”** It was a spark that would take a decade to ignite.  

After years of trial and uncertainty — from cleaning to phone repairs to commerce — Nabil found success leading a multimillion-dollar division with over 50 staff. Yet, when fatherhood called, he left it all to prioritise faith and family. That decision led to **QLand Property**, a buyers-focused agency built on value, sincerity, and guidance.  

For Nabil, business isn’t just about transactions — it’s about being a **vessel**. A vessel for his staff, helping them thrive; a vessel for his family, grounding their deen and dunya; and a vessel for his community, creating real value for families, investors, and renters alike.

**2️⃣ Surround yourself with people whose values align.**

**3️⃣ Make Allah your business partner.**  
Advice from his mother that shaped his life: “Make Allah your business partner.” Giving for Allah brings barakah no business model can calculate.

### **💬 Founder Takeaway**

“I’m glad something like Mu’assis exists. Growing up, I wished we had this. We don’t all need to agree to be united — we just need to understand that another's opinion is valid and love one another for it. It’s heartbreaking to see division in our community, but we can still do our part. I want to help bring our business community together, to strengthen the ummah.”

### **🌱 Why This Matters to Mu’assis**

Br. Nabil’s story teaches that leadership isn’t about titles — it’s about value, character, and the courage to do things differently. Through faith, perseverance, and sincerity, he reminds us that true success lies in serving others for the sake of Allah.
