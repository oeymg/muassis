### **The Flavour of Faith: Br. Rafif’s Journey to Build Australia’s Leading Indonesian Brand**

Born in Indonesia and raised in Australia, Rafif grew up with a dream to become a doctor: to help, to heal, to serve. But by his second year in biomedical science, he realised his purpose wasn’t in medicine. Instead of walking away, he finished what he started, graduating in 2022 — but with a new vision waiting to unfold.  

His first taste of entrepreneurship came even earlier, at just 18, when he was asked to run his school’s tuckshop as an alumnus. This became the beginning of Rafif’s lifelong entrepreneurial journey.  

In 2021, Rafif and his mother launched **Tuya Taste**, named after his great-grandfather, Tuya, with the intention to serve *‘to your taste’.* What began as a mobile kitchen soon evolved into something much bigger. After selling the food truck in 2022, he took over a bakso production and delivery business, which became the foundation of **Tuya Taste** as we know it today — a food hub that bridges the flavours of Indonesian cuisine into Australian homes.  

For Rafif, business is more than a means to serve his family; it’s *barakah.* He believes every action, every decision, every ounce of rizq comes from Allah — and through his intention to feed another person every day, Tuya Taste continues to grow with purpose.  

Alongside Tuya’s, Rafif is a Director at **SoulSeed Group**, fostering subhah and meaningful connections, and the Founder of **HANABI**, a marketing agency.

### **🔑 3 Insights Br. Rafif Has Gained**

**1️⃣ Victory is written.**  
Victory is as certain as the victory of Makkah — the only unknowns are when, how, and where. When you truly believe that Allah is the Giver of success, fear has nothing to stand on.  

**2️⃣ Allah is Ar-Razzaq.**  
Nothing you achieve comes from you. When you understand that Allah is the sole Provider, it liberates you from the dunya. Muslims have a superpower — *tawakkul* — the trust that every outcome is already written and out of your control.  

**3️⃣ Actions are as big as your intentions.**  
Your intentions shape your circle, and your circle shapes your impact. Surround yourself with companions who elevate your vision, who push you to build, serve, and dream beyond yourself — because no great action is achieved alone.

### **🌱 Why This Matters to Mu’assis**

Mu’assis exists to be a vehicle for these values — a means to nurture mentorship, guidance, and purpose in our community. Rafif’s story reminds us that entrepreneurship isn’t just about ideas; it’s about *intention.* When we build for Allah, with the right people beside us, our work becomes worship, and our vision becomes legacy.
